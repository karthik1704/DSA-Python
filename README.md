# DSA - Python
    - Data structures and algotithms in Python
## Data structures
> Data stuctures are different ways of organizing data on your computer that can be used effectively.

## Algorithm
> Set of steps to accomplish a task
- Set of rules for a computer program to accomplish a task
### Good algorithm 
- Correctness 
- Efficiency

## Importance of DSA
- Data structures refers to the way we organize information on computer/data 
- Algorithm is  steps we need to in order to get the output correctly and efficienly.

## Type of data structure
- 2 Basic DS
    - Primitive 
        - Provide by Programming Language
        - Integer
        - Float 
        - Character
        - String
        - Boolean
    - Non-Primitive
        - User-defined DS ,
        - it's Derived from primitive data types by combining two or more primitive DS
        - Subdivided as,
            - Linear
                - the data items arranged in memory in a linear , sequential manner
                - Either static or dynamic
                - Staic
                    > sizes and structures associated memory locations are fixed, at compile time
                    - Array
                - Dynamic
                    - 
                    - Linked List
                    - Stack
                    - Queue
            - Non-linear
